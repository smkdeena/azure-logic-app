As Per the Microsoft, Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations. Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions for app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) communication, whether in the cloud, on premises, or both.

For example, here are just a few workloads you can automate with logic apps:

Process and route orders across on-premises systems and cloud services.

Send email notifications with Office 365 when events happen in various systems, apps, and services.

Move uploaded files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure Storage.

Monitor tweets for a specific subject, analyze the sentiment, and create alerts or tasks for items that need review.
